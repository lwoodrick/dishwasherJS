# dishwasherJS
An app of questionable utility for determining what precisely to do when approaching the office dishwasher and sink.

How much is there to say? Drag the index into the browser, make the changes in the JavaScript file, MAGIC.

As the reason this exists is to provide a reason to practice JavaScript, feel free to clone this baby and refactor the code into something usable (I still plan to, as of yet).
